I wanted to learn Rust in a more formal manner than just diving into a project, and Rustlings is the perfect way to learn and code along. 
This is a documentation of my progress on this journey in the hopes of developing a deeper understanding of the Rust programming language.

The official Rustlings repository can be found here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
